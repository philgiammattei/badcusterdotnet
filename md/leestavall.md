# ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ STOP SCROLLING. THIS IS A BAD CUSTER ALERT ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

## _A UNIQUE, ONE-TIME-ONLY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY AWAITS YOUR ATTENTION_

## *In August, BAD CUSTER will go to [Leesta Vall Records](https://leestavall.com) in Brooklyn.  That's in NEW Y0RK CITY.  We are bringing ***ALL OF OUR MUSIC STUFF.***

## There, we will play songs and the songs will get recorded. **BUT! NOT ON COMPUTER!**

# NO PRO TOOLS
# NO LOGIC
# NO GARAGE BAND

## We play a song, and it gets mixed and mastered **LIVE**, then it is _ENGRAVED_ ONTO A VINYL RECORD.

# THAT'S IT

## Confused?!!! Let me _break it down again_

## 1. We play a song
## 2. That song is engraved onto a RECORD
# 3. THAT's iT

## That record has the only version of that song that will EVER BE MADE.  it is VERY VALUABLE.  This is kind of like _NFTs_ but _BETTER_

## YOU CAN OWN A PIECE OF BAD CUSTER HISTORY, TO PASS DOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. _NO TWO ARE ALIKE!!_
